[Installing CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)
[Installing Boost](https://theboostcpplibraries.com/introduction-installation)

## Building the Compiler

To build the compiler first run the `configure` command and make sure that you get no errors in the process.

### Building for Debug

Change directories to `build/Debug` and run the `make` command. The output of the compilation should be in the `/target` folder.

### Building for Release

Change directories to `build/Release` and run the `make` command. The output of the compilation should be in the `/target` folder.
